# Java Playground

This repository contains my exercises and experiments while learning Java syntax and core concepts.

With some prior experience in PHP and Python, the focus here has been on adapting to Java's syntax.

## Structure

The project is organized as a small utility library, keeping logic separate from the interface and tests.

- **src/main/java**: Contains the logic classes (MathUtils, StringUtils, SortingUtils) and the Main entry point.
- **src/test/java**: Contains unit tests using JUnit 5 and AssertJ.

## Implementation Details

- **Logic**: Focus on algorithmic problem solving (loops, arrays, conditionals).
- **Testing**: Separation of concerns to ensure code is testable.
- **Tooling**: Built using IntelliJ IDEA and standard Java 25.
